# PURE-GOAL.md — reduce slim-vim to an embedded editor

`slim-vim.c` is vim as one translation unit, with every feature upstream's
`tiny` configuration has. **`pure-vim.c` is what is left when the editor stops
expecting a filesystem to have been installed for it.**

```
slim-vim.c = F(upstream@sha)          SLIM-GOAL.md, ten phases
pure-vim.c = G(slim-vim.c)            this document
```

The two pipelines are the same construct — a phase is a function of the tree it
is handed, memoized in three tiers — and differ only in what they remove.
`SLIM-GOAL.md` removes *files and preprocessor* and changes nothing about what
the editor can do. **This one removes capability, on purpose**, and every phase
has to say which and prove it removed nothing else.

## The charter

Pure vim is an **embedded** editor: one static binary, no installation, nothing
read from disk that was not compiled in. That is a different product from
slim-vim rather than a better one, and both are kept.

Four kinds of work, in rough order of value:

1. **Pruning** — capability that presumes an installed runtime.
2. **Dropping dependencies**, at run time and at build time. An embedded target
   cares less about bytes than about what it needs from the world.
3. **Simplification** — what the removals leave behind, which is usually more
   than they took.
4. **Optimisation** — last, because measuring it before the shape has settled
   optimises the wrong thing.

## What is measured

**Binary size and external surface**, reported by `make pure-score`:

| | what it says |
| --- | --- |
| stripped bytes | what the target has to store |
| libc symbols still referenced | what the target has to provide |
| source lines | how much is left to reason about |

The symbol set is the one that matters. An embedded target is defined by what
it must supply, not by what it costs, and a phase that shrinks the binary while
adding a syscall has gone backwards. **Both numbers go in the same direction or
the phase is wrong.**

## The rules

1. **Removal is computed, not listed.** Cut the entry points — a command row,
   an option default, a branch of the environment layer — and let the dead-code
   sweep find what becomes unreachable. A phase that names 900 functions to
   delete has written down what the compiler already knows, and will be wrong
   the first time upstream moves.
2. **Every phase states its delta, in advance, as a check.** This is the whole
   difference from `SLIM-GOAL.md`, where any behavioural change is a bug. Here
   a change is the *point*, so the phase must say which behaviour changes and
   the harness must show exactly that set and no more. "Six cases differ" is a
   check; "some cases differ" is not.
3. **A command is never deleted from the table; it is pointed at `ex_ni`.**
   `enum CMD_index`, `cmdnames[]` and the derived `ex_cmdidxs` block keep their
   shape, nothing renumbers, and the trap `SLIM-GOAL.md` records — deleting
   `:help` makes the name resolve to `:helpclose` — cannot fire. The command
   still parses and reports that it is not implemented, which is also the
   honest answer for an editor that has no runtime to show you.
4. **`pure-vim.c` is produced from the committed `slim-vim.c`**, not from a
   pass. The two pipelines are decoupled: `make pure-vim` needs no clone, no
   network and no agent, and the memoize key is `slim-vim.c`'s digest and the
   implementation's, exactly as the other pipeline keys on upstream's sha.

## Phase 0 — seed, and prove the copy is a copy

`pure-vim.c` starts as a byte-for-byte copy of `slim-vim.c`, and the phase's
only job is to establish that. It matters because everything after it is
measured as a delta: if the seed is not identical, every later phase's report
is against the wrong thing.

The check is `cmp`, and the boundary digest is the same file's.

## Phase 1 — no `$VIMRUNTIME`

**The first ground truth: there is no runtime directory.** Nothing is installed
beside the binary, so every path that goes looking for one is dead weight and,
worse, a promise the editor cannot keep — `:help` that opens nothing is more
confusing than `:help` that says it is not implemented.

Four entry points are cut, and everything unreachable behind them is *found*
rather than listed:

- **Six command rows point at `ex_ni`**: `:help`, `:helpclose`, `:helptags`,
  `:runtime`, `:exusage`, `:viusage`. All six exist only to read or display
  files from the runtime directory.
- **`'helpfile'` and `'runtimepath'` default to `""`**, in both halves of the
  `{vi, vim}` pair. They named `$VIMRUNTIME/doc/help.txt` and a five-element
  path through `~/.vim` and `$VIM/vimfiles`.
- **The `VIMRUNTIME` branches of `vim_getenv()` and `vim_setenv()` go.** That
  is the layer that *derives* a runtime directory from the executable's own
  path when the variable is unset, which is precisely the behaviour an embedded
  binary must not have.
- **The `help.c` region** — 981 lines, 13 functions — is then unreachable and
  the sweep removes it, along with whatever else it was the only caller of.

**The delta this is allowed to cause**, and nothing else: the six commands
report `E319` instead of acting, and `:set helpfile? runtimepath?` report
empty. Every other behaviour case, every other Ex command, every pty scenario
and the whole terminal table are unchanged. The harness checks exactly that
against `slim-vim`'s recorded baselines, and then records `pure-vim`'s own.

### The trap

`:help` is not the only way in. `'helpfile'` is read by anything that opens
help, `$VIMRUNTIME` is consulted by the vimrc search, and `:runtime` is what
`:packadd` was built on. Cutting the commands without cutting the option
defaults leaves an editor that still tries to open a file it will never find —
which is why the option defaults are part of *this* phase and not a later one.

## What comes next

Not yet done, in the order they are worth doing:

- **`'runtimepath'` and the file-lookup layer**: `:source`, `$VIM`, `~/.vim`,
  the vimrc search. Phase 1 empties the option; this removes the machinery.
- **State on disk**: viminfo, swap files, sessions, views. An embedded editor
  that writes four dotfiles into `$HOME` is not embedded.
- **Build-time dependencies**: what the compile line still assumes about the
  host — the headers included, the libc features used, the locale and iconv
  layers, and whether any of it can be answered at compile time instead.
- **Optimisation**, last and deliberately: `-O0` is right for a tree rebuilt
  more often than it is run, and wrong for a binary shipped to a device.
